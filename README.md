# ft_linear_regression

_42 School project_
In this project, the aim was to implement a linear regression with one variable.

### Train your program
Just execute ```./run_trainer [data.csv]``` where _data.csv_ is a 2-columns csv file, with the first line as data names.

At the end of execution, the program will generate a graph with scatter plots in red, and the computed slope in red

The trainer will create a file named _data_thetas.csv_.

### Guess a feature
```./run_predictor [data_thetas.csv]``` will ask you your first column value, then return the feature value.
